I'm quality maniac with passion about Java, Groovy, JVM and fancy tools that
help to test code in smart, fluent and expressive way. I love bringing feedback
loops to the micro-level. My main area of interest is Agile Testing. Currently
I'm working as a fully cross-functional member of a strongly agile team as a
developer and a „quality guard” with particular focus on well-written code, good
requirements and efficient process. Unlike majority of QA’s, I believe that
being a truly good QA engineer means being, first of all, a software developer
that has all the knowledge needed to deliver production-quality code with some
additional quality-related skills.
