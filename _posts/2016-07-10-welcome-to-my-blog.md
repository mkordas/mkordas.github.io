Recently I was travelling by train with [Sebastian
Malaca](http://letstalkaboutjava.blogspot.com) to
[Confitura](http://2016.confitura.pl) conference and he asked me: where is my
blog? Then I gave a lot of various excuses: it's not ready yet, it requires a
lot of work, it needs to be ideal before publishing or it requires entire
infrastructure first. However, Sebastian convinced me that the time to market
and showing the results early is more important. So here it is, welcome!
